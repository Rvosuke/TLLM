The 5G Network Traffic dataset provides metrics for analyzing the performance of 5G cellular networks in urban environments. It includes measurements collected over a 24-hour period with hourly resolution. Throughput across various cell sites and beam configurations, featuring: Raw throughput values, 9-hour moving averages (MA) to capture longer-term traffic trends, Log-transformed moving averages (base 10) to address the high variance in traffic volumes.
